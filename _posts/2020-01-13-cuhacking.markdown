Carleton University's 2020 cuHacking had 500 members from around the world. It was a 48-hour hackathon with many sponsors and many challenges. It was truly an amazing opportunity for aspiring hackers.

I managed to form a team, however it was disbanded 6 hours in. Without a team and enough experience to make a hack alone, I folded early.

This was my first hackathon experience, but not what I'd consider to be my first hackathon. Indeed, going in alone with rudimentary programming experience is certainly suboptimal. This is a lesson to be learned for uOttahack next month.
