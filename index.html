  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a second-year undergraduate student studying Biomedical Mechanical Engineering and
    Computing Technology in the University of Ottawa. I've always wanted to make an impact on
    society by improving quality of life through prosthetics and bionics.</p>
  <p>I am currently the technical captain of <a href="https://uobionics.com">uOttawa Bionics</a>, a multidisciplinary engineering
    team developing mechatronic and bionic devices to enhance quality of life and facilitate rehabilitation.</p>

  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <h2>Whiteboard Writer</h2>
    <p>A team project for GNG1103 (Engineering Design). The AutoScribe uses strings and encoders to display whiteboard notes on Ross Video DashBoard. It also lets teams email their whiteboard to themselves.</p>
  <h2>Hip Exoskeleton</h2>
    <p>A team project for uOttawa Bionics. The team is currently developing a 4-DOF hip-mounted exoskeleton to assist in the rehabilitation of stroke patients with reduced muscular strength.</p>

  <h2>Infant Resuscitation Manikin</h2>
    <p>A team project for the 2019 Biobuddy Design Competition. Our team designed the Resuscitation Infant Training Aid (RITA), a manikin that provides haptic, visual, and auditory feedback in order to enhance CPR training.</p>
  <h2>Multicolour Pen</h2>
    <p>An individual project for MCG1100 (Introduction to Mechanical Engineering). SolidWorks was used to model an assembly of a multicolour pen.
    </p>
  <h2>Lights Out</h2>
    <p>An individual project for ITI1121 (Introduction to Computing II). Using Java's Swing GUI, a functional game was built involving the game Lights Out, with buttons to reset the board, randomize the board, toggle the most efficient solution, and quits the application.</p>
