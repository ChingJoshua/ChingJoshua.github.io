It was a great pleasure to participate in the uOttawa Engineering Competition (uOEC) alongside my teammates and friends, Clark Chen, Amit Nayak, and Sam Tremblay.

We were tasked to devise a lawn maintenance device from household materials that plants seeds, cuts grass, and waters the lawn. We had the opportunity to improve our ideation, manufacturing, and presentation skills.

For our efforts, we were awarded first place out of 7 teams in the Junior Design category and will be heading to Guelph in January to participate in the Ontario Engineering Competition!

Thank you to the Engineering Students’ Society for making this event possible!

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
